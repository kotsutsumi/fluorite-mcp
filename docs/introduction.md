# Introduction to Fluorite MCP

## What is Fluorite MCP?

Fluorite MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a server designed to supercharge code generation assistants like Claude Code CLI. It acts as a specialized knowledge base, providing deep, contextual information about a vast array of modern development libraries, language ecosystems, and architectural patterns.

By connecting Fluorite MCP, your AI assistant can move beyond generic code snippets and generate solutions that are:

- **Accurate & Practical**: Using correct imports, up-to-date APIs, and idiomatic patterns.
- **Production-Ready**: Incorporating best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.
- **Comprehensive**: Drawing from a curated collection of over 50 essential libraries, 7 language ecosystems, and 8 modern technology stacks.

In essence, Fluorite MCP bridges the gap between a large language model's general coding ability and the specific, nuanced knowledge required for professional software development.

## Core Features

- **📚 Deep Library Knowledge**: Provides comprehensive specifications for over 50 essential libraries, including precise import statements, type definitions, and common implementation patterns. No more guessing at library APIs.

- **🌐 Multi-Language Ecosystems**: Supports 7 major language ecosystems, including Zig, Elixir, Go, Dart/Flutter, and C#/Unity, enabling high-quality code generation across different platforms.

- **🚀 Comprehensive Modern Tech Stacks**: Covers 8 critical areas of modern development, such as AI/ML integration, cloud-native infrastructure, advanced data processing, and mobile development.

- **⚡ Instant, High-Quality Code Generation**: Enables the creation of production-ready code with correct dependencies and best practices baked in from the start.

- **🎯 Built-in Best Practices**: Embeds knowledge of security, performance, and design patterns directly into the code generation process.

- **🔍 Static Analysis & Error Prediction**: Includes over 50 validation rules for common frameworks like Next.js, React, and Vue, helping to identify and prevent common pitfalls and anti-patterns before they become runtime errors.
