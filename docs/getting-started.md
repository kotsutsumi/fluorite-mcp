## What is Fluorite MCP?

Fluorite MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enhances Claude Code CLI with:

- **üìö 90+ Library Specifications**: Deep knowledge of modern web development libraries
- **üåç 12 Language Ecosystems**: From TypeScript to Rust, covering all major platforms
- **üß™ 1000+ Spike Templates**: Pre-built patterns for rapid prototyping
- **üîç Static Analysis**: 50+ validation rules for Next.js, React, Vue
- **ü§ñ Error Prediction**: AI-powered pattern matching to prevent runtime errors

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Fluorite MCP

```bash
# Install globally via npm
npm i -g fluorite-mcp
```

### Step 2: Add to Claude Code CLI

```bash
# Connect to Claude Code CLI
claude mcp add fluorite -- fluorite-mcp
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
# Test the connection
claude mcp list
# You should see 'fluorite' in the list
```

### Step 4: Try Your First Command

Open Claude Code and try:

```
Create a modern React data table with sorting and filtering using TypeScript
```

Claude will automatically use Fluorite MCP's knowledge of TanStack Table, TypeScript patterns, and best practices to generate production-ready code!

## Understanding Key Features

### 1. Automatic Library Knowledge

When you mention any supported library, Claude automatically accesses the relevant specification:

**Example Libraries**:
- UI Components: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Material-UI
- State Management: Zustand, Jotai, TanStack Query
- Forms: react-hook-form, Zod validation
- Data Tables: AG Grid, TanStack Table
- Authentication: NextAuth.js, Clerk, Supabase

### 2. Static Analysis & Error Prediction

Fluorite MCP includes intelligent code analysis:

```bash
# Static analysis is automatically applied when Claude analyzes your code
# Detects 50+ common issues in Next.js, React, and Vue
```

**Common Issues Detected**:
- Client hooks in Server Components
- Hydration mismatches
- Missing dependencies
- Type safety violations
- Performance anti-patterns

### 3. Spike-Driven Development

Quick prototyping with pre-built templates:

**Available Template Categories**:
- **Next.js**: Minimal apps, API routes, authentication
- **FastAPI**: REST APIs, database integration, auth
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD workflows, testing pipelines
- **Playwright**: Testing configurations, accessibility

### 4. Comprehensive Ecosystems

Access to complete development ecosystems:

**Language Ecosystems**:
- TypeScript/JavaScript (Web development)
- Python (FastAPI, Django, Data Science)
- Rust (Systems programming, Tauri)
- Go (High-performance backends)
- Ruby (Rails development)
- And 7 more...

## Your First Commands

### Creating UI Components

```
Create a responsive navigation component using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
```

**What happens**:
- Claude accesses `spec://radix-ui-themes`
- Uses proper TypeScript patterns
- Includes accessibility features
- Applies modern CSS practices

### Building APIs

```
Create a FastAPI endpoint with JWT authentication and Pydantic validation
```

**What happens**:
- Claude uses `spec://fastapi-ecosystem`
- Includes security best practices
- Proper error handling
- Type-safe response models

### Setting Up Testing

```
Set up Playwright testing with accessibility checking
```

**What happens**:
- Uses `spec://playwright-axe-accessibility`
- Configures proper test structure
- Includes CI/CD integration
- Adds accessibility validation

### Spike Development

```
I need to experiment with drag-and-drop functionality for a tree component
```

**What happens**:
- Claude suggests relevant spike templates
- Provides rapid prototyping setup
- Includes validation strategies
- Offers integration guidance
