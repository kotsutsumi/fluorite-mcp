- `fluorite-mcp`: CLI tool for SuperClaude commands
- `fluorite-mcp-server`: MCP server binary for Claude Code integration

### Version Management
- Detects development versions (0.10.0) vs. npm versions
- Handles npm link for local development
- Manages global installations correctly

### Claude Code Integration
- Proper MCP server registration
- Connection testing and validation
- Configuration file management

## Troubleshooting

If the scripts themselves don't work:

1. **Permission Issues**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

2. **Path Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Run from project root
   cd /path/to/fluorite-mcp
   ./scripts/setup-mcp-connection.sh
   ```

3. **Shell Compatibility**:
   - Scripts are written for bash
   - Should work on macOS, Linux, and WSL2
   - For other shells, review script content and adapt as needed
